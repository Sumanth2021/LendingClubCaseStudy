## General Information
- The project utilizes loan data and its data dictionary, providing a foundation for EDA.
- Prior to analysis, data cleaning and manipulation are necessary steps.
- The identification of numerical and categorical variables, along with metric derivation, is crucial.
- Univariate and bivariate analysis will be conducted.

## Data Processing
To prepare the data for analysis, the following steps are performed:
- Cleaning and handling missing values.
- Exploring and addressing outliers.
- Transforming variables for better representation.
- Feature engineering to derive relevant metrics.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves the examination of key factors influencing the risk of loan default. This includes:
- Visualization of trends and patterns.
- Uncovering relationships between variables.
- Identification of outliers and influential data points.
- Statistical insights into the dataset.

## Conclusion
The study has identified five driving factors influencing the probability of loan default:
1. Term
2. Employee length
3. Annual income
4. Purpose
5. Grade

## Programming Language and Libraries Used
- Language: Python 3.11.5
- Libraries: Pandas (v  2.0.3), Seaborn (v0.12.2)
